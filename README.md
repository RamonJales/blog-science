# blog-science
I'm trying to make a site about science outreach with spring technologies, 
just to put my skills to work and for contribute to science popularization in such difficult times - compounded by misinformation. 
This first commit show that my project is running without problem. 
So far, i have configured the database in the "aplication.properties" file, tested the controller and html integration.

This blog is made using java web technologies and not with api. Controller responses are static pages and not json.
