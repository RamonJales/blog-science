I'm trying to make a site about science outreach with spring technologies, 
just to put my skills to work and for contribute to science popularization in such difficult times - compounded by misinformation. 
This first commit show that my project is running without problem. 
So far, i have configured the database in the "aplication.properties" file, tested the controller and html integration.
